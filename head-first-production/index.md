<h2>Head First Production Workflow</h2>

<p>Head First books are unique in many ways, including the production process.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Initial QA/intake (~1–3 days)</dt>
<dd><p>Production editor takes a look at the InDesign files submitted to production and confirms we have all required fonts and graphics. Any problems due to missing links or incorrect fonts will be resolved at this point, prior to QC1 and proofread. It’s important that authors don’t make any changes to the files during this time (or at any time during production unless scheduled with the production editor).</p></dd>

<dt>QC1 (Quality Check #1)/proofread/index (~8–10 days)</dt>
<dd><p>The production editor generates a PDF of the book and sends it to the author as well as a proofreader. We also hire an indexer, who will write an index using tags embedded directly into the source files. The author and proofreader review the book and make comments on the PDF. After the QC1 period ends, the production editor enters the proofreader’s and author’s edits into the source files and sends the draft index to the author for review.</p></dd>

<dt>Index review</dt>

<dd><p>The production editor sends a draft PDF of the index to the author for review. At this time, the production editor enters QC1 edits (from the author and proofreader) into the source files. </p></dd>

<dt>QC2 (Quality Check #2)</dt>

<dd><p>The edits from QC1 have been made to the files, and the production editor generates a new PDF after inserting any necessary page breaks. The QC2 PDF goes only to the author, but the production editor also does his or her own final review of the book at this time. The indexer works in the source files to make the edits that the author has suggested.</p></dd>

<dt>OTD (“Out the Door”)</dt>

<dd><p>The production editor sends the book to a colleague for a final internal review. Nothing substantial can be changed without missing the scheduled print date.</p></dd>

<dt>FTP (Files to Printer)</dt>

<dd><p>Once the final files have been approved, we send everything to the printer!</p></dd>

<dt>Post-Prod</dt>

<dd><p>The production editor takes care of post-production, which involves requesting final ebook formats (.epub and .mobi) for distribution to the necessary channels. The production editor also sends the author a final email with instructions detailing how authors can use the Errata Portal and stay up-to-date with their books. Once this email goes out, production is officially finished! In general, printed books are available in stores ~15 business days after the FTP date.</p></dd>

<h2>Head First Style Sheet Conventions</h2>

<section data-type="sect3" id="annotations">
<h3>Annotations</h3>

<p>Should end with a period if they contain one or more complete sentences. Otherwise, if it's a phrase or fragment, no period. Watch out for two periods at the end of a sentence in these. (It's hard to see periods in the Skippy Sharp font onscreen, so authors often add an extra by mistake.) Never put text in annotations in black (it should always be 61% gray). To emphasize words, use hand-drawn underlines with the pencil tool.</p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect3" id="code">
<h3>Code</h3>

<p>Single and double quotation marks in code should be straight, not curly. You can find the correct characters in the Type → Glyphs window.</p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect3" id="crossword_puzzles">
<h3>Crossword Puzzles (This is currently under construction because Crossword Forge no longer exists!)</h3>

<p>A PDF listing the settings in the authors subdomain, but a quick rundown follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We use Crossword Forge to create the crossword puzzles. Download the software from http://www.solrobots.com/ and we'll get authors a license key.</p></li>
<li><p>Questions font: Arial Narrow 12pt Black (set it by selecting part of a question, then picking the correct font from the list)</p></li>
<li><p>Answers font: Marker Felt 12pt Black (set it by selecting part of an answer, then picking the correct font from the list)</p></li>
<li><p>Page size (in the File > Page Setup menu): Legal.</p></li>
<li><p>Backdrop: Select Solid color, then click on the color to bring up the color dialog. Choose the sliders option and set the dropdown to Gray Scale Slider. Select the back square, then type 75 into brightness % field. Click okay.</p></li>
<li><p>Grid: Make sure your crossword grid doesn't touch the edges of the printable area by clicking 'Make puzzle' until you get a configuration you're happy with.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a PDF File → PRINT (but choose to "print" it as a PDF using the dropdown in the bottom left of the dialog).</p></li>
<li><p>You'll need to do this twice: once with the crossword showing the empty grid and once with the solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Name each file something sensible like hfxx_ch01_xword_q.pdf (for the questions) and hfxx_ch01_xword_a.pdf (for the answers).</p></li>
<li><p>When you're ready, open your InDesign file and place the PDFs. You may need to re-size them slightly.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section data-type="sect3" id="troubleshooting">
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>If you have lots of questions, make sure you check to see if everything fits on just one page when you "print" it to PDF (if it's more than one page, a scrollbar appears). If it goes over, make sure you've got it set up (in the File > Page Setup menu) to use the LEGAL size (the default size is US LETTER). If it still goes over, remove some questions and solutions.</p>

<section data-type="sect3" id="console_elements">
<h3>Console Elements (Need these cleared up, they're contradictory)</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Must always have "joke" text for the last menu in the menu bar (e.g., File Edit Window Help Macarena)</p></li>
<li><p>Shouldn't always have a joke—that would get tired pretty quick in a book like SQL where we show the console a lot. Perhaps a joke for every significant event or something?</p></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section data-type="sect3" id="dotted_lines_in_exercises">
<h3>Dotted lines in exercises</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Blank lines should be: 100% Black and dotted.</p></li>
<li><p>You can change the annotations used as solution text to have a Leading of 16pt to make them look less like annotations. Leading is the same as line spacing. To change it, look for the top right-hand option in the two column dropdowns in the Character palette (the A above another A with a vertical double-headed arrow next to the bottom A).</p></li>
<li><p>Then make sure your dotted lines are just beneath each line of text. You may or may not want to repeat the blanks in the solution. Sometimes they're useful, other times, they make it harder to see what's going on (if there are a lot of annotations, for instance).</p></li>
<li><p>[NB British authors: a blank is not a space (as we are used to), but a dotted line denoting a blank space above it for the learner to write in. If your editor asks for blanks, put in some dotted lines!]</p></li>
</ul>

<section data-type="sect3" id="exercises">
<h3>Exercises</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Usually should be on recto pages, and whenever possible we put solutions on the following verso page. (We really, really try to avoid putting the solutions in upside-down text at the bottom of the exercise.)</p></li>
<li><p>If answers are not on the following page, exercise should have the text "Answers on page xx", and the exercise solution should have the text "From page xx". Instructions should usually be duplicated on solutions page.</p></li>
<li><p>The "Answers on page xx" element is included in the exercises library included with the template [hf_exercises.indl]</p></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section data-type="sect3" id="fireside_chats">
<h3>Fireside Chats</h3>

<p>Headers for the two "characters" talking should appear on both pages if chat covers a full spread.</p>

<section data-type="sect3" id="hand_drawn_underlines">
<h3>Hand-drawn underlines</h3>

<p>Should match the shade of black used in the text—e.g., underlines in annotations should be 61% gray, and those in sidebars should be 100% black.</p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect3" id="heads">
<h3>Headers</h3>

<p>Standard heads at the top of the page should be sentence capped. In other words, only the first word is capitalized. All other words are lowercase.</p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect3" id="page_goal_headers">
<h3>Page-Goal Headers</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>On the top of every verso page. Always contain custom text that summarizes what the page is about. When possible, should not duplicate the text of any Heads on the page. Alternately shaded black and gray to highlight.</p></li>
<li><p>Should be done absolute last thing when all the pagination is correct. Because they're page template items and are aligned using the spine, this can cause "unlocked" headers (e.g. those that have been altered by the author) to "ghost" behind the chapter title on recto pages.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section data-type="sect3" id="screenshots">
<h3>Screenshots</h3> 

<p>I've added information on screenshots to the Authors subdomain. Those of you who need to take screenshots should check it out, there are some useful shortcuts up there.</p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect3" id="urls">
<h3>URLs</h3>

<p>Use the character style Emphasic_Italics, not Code. (Note from Sanders: Yes, I know this a departure from the past, but it's consistent with styles in all O'Reilly's other book series, it makes it easier to fit long URLs on one line, and I think it looks prettier. So I'm going to bat for this one.) [Same goes for pathnames, filenames, and directories.]</p>
